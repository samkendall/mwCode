 * Effect's Migrator skips any migration whose id is <= the highest id already

 * If a fork migration shared upstream's `effect_sql_migrations` table with a
 * high id (e.g. 900), then after any upstream sync every future upstream
 * migration (044+) would be silently skipped, corrupting the schema. Keeping
